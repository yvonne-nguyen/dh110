## Purpose
My project is centered around an app that assists users in finding and scheduling a vaccine. The purpose of an interactive prototype brings one's design "to life". Through creating an interactive prototype and asking users to test it (e.g., via through a cognitive walkthrough), one can get a gist of how a user will use one's product.  

### Tasks That This Prototype Supports
1. A notice that lists the information the user will need in order to successfully schedule a flu vaccine.
2. The user can select which type of vaccine they would like to schedule.
3. The user can input their address and select their perferred distance of the vaccination site's proximity. 
4. The user can filter and sort the results of vaccination sites.  
5. The user can schedule a vaccine of their choice through selecting which time and date they would like.
6. The user can fill out their personal information, their insurance information, and their primary physician's information.
