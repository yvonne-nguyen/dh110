# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype 
Yvonne Nguyen | DH 110

### Purpose
Low-fidelity prototypes serve as a low-cost and quick means for one to test one's design prior to investing time and money into producing high-fidelity prototypes. During this process, one sketches out wireframes and wireflows and then present it to one's target user. This process allows one to get feedback from users in order to make adjustments/iterations to one's design early on in the design process. 

### User Research
Based on the interview I conducted from user research, I will take into consideration these factors as I design my prototype:
1. How can I present which information is required from the user in a clear and concise way?
2. How can I design an intuitive system that allows users to quickly find and schedule a vaccine?

Based on my user research, I notice that factors such as (1) location of the vaccination site and (2) co-pay factor into whether the patient chooses a certain vaccination location or not. In addition, throughout the scheduling process, the factor that proved to be the most confusing is deciding whether filling out certain information is required or optional. More information regarding my user research can be found [here](https://github.com/yvonne-nguyen/dh110/blob/main/assignments/assignment-3.md)

### Personas
I created 2 personas:
1. A college aged individual who is confused about (1) which information (e.g., insurance information) they need in order to successfully complete the application and (2) is unsure which information is required or optional. 
2. A middle aged individual who wants to find a location that caters to their work schedule.

Based on these personas, and the user journey maps that went along with each, I decided to implement these 2 features in my design:
1. A notice that appears prior to the user begining their scheeduling application that details which information they need on hand in order to successfully compelete the application. 
2. A filter option that allows users to filter out locations based on the distance/proximity and vaccination avaliability (based on which vaccine is avaliable on a given date and within a given hour, not which *types* of vaccines are avaliable at a given location). More information regarding my personas can be found [here](https://github.com/yvonne-nguyen/dh110/blob/main/assignments/assignment-4.md).

## Tasks
1. Schedule a vaccine appointment.
2. Find out which information is needed in order to complete the scheduling application. 
3. Filter results by distance (1 mile) and time/date (Oct 2, 2021 at 3PM).
4. Sort by distance (closest to furthest).
5. Edit a typo found on the "summary" page.

## User Testing

## Reflection
As I was designing my wireframes and wireflow, I tried to put myself in the shoes of my users to see if my design choices made sense/is useful. At times, I was unsure if my process was "right". I wasn't sure if I was supposed to design all of the wireframe screens at once or one at a time. I ended up opting for one at a time and made a lot of edits along the way. One regret I have was not documenting the inital ideas I had. I will try my best to document every design change/iteration I make in the future. As for the wireframing process, I tried my best to "color code" each feature but it looks kind of messy on some pages. I'm not sure how to do this in a neater way. Additionally, I designed on dark mode. Dark mode is just a personal preference but I notice that the highlight colors do not show up as brightly. I think I should sketch my wireframes and wireflows on light mode next time.
