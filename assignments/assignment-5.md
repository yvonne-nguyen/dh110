# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype

### Purpose
Low-fidelity prototypes serve as a low-cost and quick means for one to test one's design prior to investing time and money into producing high-fidelity prototypes. During this process, one sketches out wireframes and wireflows and then present it to one's target user. This process allows one to get feedback from users in order to make adjustments/iterations to one's design early on in the design process. 

### User Research
Based on the interview I conducted from user research, I will take into consideration these factors as I design my prototype:
1. How can I present which information is required from the user in a clear and concise way?
2. How can I design an intuitive system that allows users to quickly find and schedule a vaccine?

Based on my user research, I notice that factors such as (1) location of the vaccination site and (2) co-pay factor into whether the patient chooses a certain vaccination location or not. In addition, throughout the scheduling process, the factor that proved to be the most confusing is deciding whether filling out certain information is required or optional. More information regarding my user research can be found [here](https://github.com/yvonne-nguyen/dh110/blob/main/assignments/assignment-3.md)

### Personas
I created 2 personas:
1. A college aged individual who is confused about (1) which information (e.g., insurance information) they need in order to successfully complete the application and (2) is unsure which information is required or optional. 
2. A middle aged individual who wants to find a location that caters to their work schedule.

Based on these personas, and the user journey maps that went along with each, I decided to implement these 2 features in my design:
1. A notice that appears prior to the user begining their scheeduling application that details which information they need on hand in order to successfully compelete the application. 
2. A filter option that allows users to filter out locations based on the distance/proximity and vaccination avaliability (based on which vaccine is avaliable on a given date and within a given hour, not which *types* of vaccines are avaliable at a given location). More information regarding my personas can be found [here](https://github.com/yvonne-nguyen/dh110/blob/main/assignments/assignment-4.md).
