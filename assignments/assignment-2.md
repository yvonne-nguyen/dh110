## Introduction

## Background
Usability Testing (hereforward will be referred to as "UT) seeks to assess usability metrics of a product by testing it on users. UT asks users to complete certain tasks based on a given sceanrio. Through observing the user completing the task and listening to their reasoning and feedback along the way, one is able to get a glimsp at how people will actually use the product. UT is thus able able to measure a product's effectiveness, efficency, and satisfaction based on the context of how the user is navigating the product and performing the tasks. 

Based on my heutristic evaluation, the Oregon Health Authority website organizes the content of their website in a confusing manner. It is difficult to navigate to certain pages in order to find the specific information one is look for. Because this website contains a plethora of information information, because it could be difficult to navigate, users could miss some useful information. Additionally, the header bar is too big and dimishes the usefulness of tools implemented with the intention of making the site easier to navigate (e.g., clicking on a tab will take one to a specific header).  

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem | Task Scenario 
----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------
Consistency and Standards | Information related to the same topic is shown selectively throughout the website. | The user will be tasked to find information regarding the fees of ordering a birth cirtificate. 
Visibility of System Status | Clickable links on a given page that is implemented with the intention of quickly taking users to that section on the page does not function well. | The user will be tasked to use the clickable links on a page to find a specific year related to finding a PDF of data pertaing to teenage pregnancy rates.
Match Between System and Real World | The website uses confusing diction for their headers. | The user will be tasked to find "vaccine and immunizations" page.

## Methodlogy 
The test will be conducted over Zoom. I will ask the user to share their screen and I will record the session. I will start off by introducing myself and give the user an overview about the nature of what this pilot UT session will entail. Afterwards, I will read to them the consent form. We will start off with pre-test questions that aim to see if the user is familar with the website and their first impression of the website. We will then proceed to task 1: ordering a birth cirtificate. After task 1, instead of moving forwards to task 2 right away, I will give the user the post-test questionaire. I prefer giving the post-test questionaire related to that task right away, rather after all of the tasks are complete because the user's memory of completing that task is still fresh.
