## Background

One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, 
how 
& what you want to test especially based on the findings of your heuristic evaluation.

Usability Testing (hereforward will be referred to as "UT) seeks to assess usability metrics of a product by testing it on users. UT asks users to complete certain tasks based on a given sceanrio. Through observing the user completing the task and listening to their reasoning and feedback along the way, one is able to get a glimsp at how people will actually use the product. UT is thus able able to measure a product's effectiveness, efficency, and satisfaction based on the context of how the user is navigating the product and performing the tasks. 

Based on my heutristic evaluation, the Oregon Health Authority website organizes the content of their website in a confusing manner. It is difficult to navigate to certain pages in order to find the specific information one is look for. Because this website contains a plethora of information information, because it could be difficult to navigate, users could miss some useful information. Additionally, the header bar is too big and dimishes the usefulness of tools implemented with the intent of making the site easier to navigate (e.g., clicking on a tab will take one to a specific header).
