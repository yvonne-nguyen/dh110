## Design Challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project will help users find locations that offer flu vaccines and assist them in scheduling an appointment.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
The CDC recommends that anyone over the age of 6 months should get the flu vaccine every year as a preventative measure when flu seasons come about. Due to how frequently one should get this vaccine (“frequent” compared to other recommended vaccines), there should be an efficient way for one to find and schedule a vaccine appointment.

### What are the traditional/current solutions used to satisfy the needs?
A traditional solution that satisfies this need is calling one’s doctor’s office and scheduling an appointment. Aside from this, one can also schedule an appointment digitally via pharmacies such as CVS or Walgreens.

### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Some individuals might feel nervous/anxious while talking on the phone. With the option to make an appointment by oneself, without having to talk or interact with another person, this could help those who want to get the vaccine but are hesitant to do so due to social anxieties. Additionally, with a digital option to schedule an appointment, one can schedule it anytime of the day. With phone calls to the doctor’s office, if one has work or other obligations where one does not have the time to call the doctor’s office during their office hours, it might be more difficult to schedule an appointment. Sometimes, the doctor’s office phone line could be busy and one has to stay on hold for a long time.

## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
My target user:
1. not anti-vax
2. technologically adept 
3. those who are over the age of 18 because at that age, the individual does not need parental consent to schedule their own appointment
4. does not have time/feels nervous about making phone calls 
5. does not have the time to “walk-in” to a doctor’s office and wait
6. wants to get the flu vaccine 
7. is able to get the flu vaccine
8. is concerned about their health

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
Individuals who want to get the flu vaccine are concerned about their health and want to take preventative measures to prevent their chances of getting the flu. 

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
Individuals who want to make an appointment via phone would call their doctor’s office. Individuals who want to make an appointment for a flu vaccine digitally would go to their healthcare provider’s website, or the pharmacy of their choice, to make an appointment.

## Research Method
I will use two research methods: participatory observation and interview. I will observe my target users and interview them on Zoom. I will begin the Zoom session with some interview questions. I want to ask them for their opinions regarding the flu vaccine. Afterwards, I will observe the user scheduling a vaccine appointment.

## Reflection
One big mistake I made while conducting this interview/participatory observation was that I forgot to record how long Kelly took to complete the task. Rather, I had to rely on the timestamps provided by the recording. After the participatory observation, I realized that it would be helpful if the application process initally listed what information is required in order to complete the appointment because Kelly did not have certain information (e.g., insurance information) at hand. Another flaw of the interview was the setting. I conducted the interview at my partner's apartment and I did not inform their roommates that I was conducting an interview so the background noise was loud at times. Additionally, I currently have a cold so my voice was raspy and there were moments where I was coughing a lot. This is kind of outside of my control, but I wished I could’ve presented a more professional setting and manner.
