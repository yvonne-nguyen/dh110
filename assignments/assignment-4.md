## Feature 1: List Of Items the User Will Need In Order To Smoothly Schedule Their Appointment

### Sceanario with Kelly

#### Why?
Last year, Kelly scheduled her flu appointment at Walgreens for the first time. This wasn't the first time Kelly has scheduled a flu vaccination appointment online. She has done it countless times and was confident that she'll finish scheduling it in no time. The application process first starts off smooth. "Name? Birthday? Easy stuff". However, Kelly froze when she application required her insurance information. She thought her insurance card was in her wallet. Nope. She vaguely remembers that she has a photo of it on her computer. After searching for it, she still couldn’t find it. Then, she remembers that it’s in her brother’s room. However, after a heated argument, she and her brother have not spoken a word to each other in over 3 months. She still wants to avoid him. Feeling frustrated, she skips this step and waits for her mom to come home so she can ask her for the insurance information. Soon after this, the application asks her for her primary physician’s contact information. Kelly rarely sees her primary physician and does not remember their contact information. Additionally, due to the obscure wording of the application, she is unsure if this information is required or not. Since she is confused, and does not have that information, she skips this step. Afterwards, Kelly felt as though the application took longer and was a bit more difficult than she anticipated. 

#### How?
This year, she decided to ditch scheduling her appointment on Walgreens' website and [F]flu [F]inder instead. After clicking on “begin scheduling your appointment”, a notice popped up that listed all the information she would need on hand in order to successfully complete her appointment: her personal information, her desired time and date, her insurance information, her primary physician’s contact information, etc. Despite the whole debacle from last year, she forgot that she needed her insurance information. “It will be different this time”. Kelly closed the app, turned off her phone, and began looking for her insurance card. She found it in her wallet and placed it on her desk. She still doesn’t remember her primary physician’s contact information. She called her mom and wrote their contact information down on a piece of paper. Afterwards, Kelly double-checked her class schedule in order to find the most optimal time to get the flu vaccine. After she has all of this information down, she turned on her phone, and returned to app. Knowing that she has all the required information ready at hand, she felt more confident completing the application. 

## Feature 2: Filter Locations By Distance & Hours of Operations 

### Sceanario with Soren

#### Why?
Soren has a workplace audit soon and is feeling stressed out. He also realizes that he has been putting off scheduling a flu vaccine. Because his job gives him so much stress, he wants to go home and rest as soon as he leaves his office. Soren does not want to make a drive all the way to his doctor's office because it is far. Plus, he will have to sit in traffic for a long time. There is the option of going on the weekends, but he wants to spend that time with his wife or visit his children (they're in college). Hence, he wants to find a location that offers flu vaccines within a 3 mile radius of his home or workplace. Additionally, Soren gets off of work at 6pm. He knows that this is late and he does not know which locations still offer vaccinations past that time. He does not have to sift through each location’s hours of operations because that takes too much time.

#### How?
When Soren began to schedule his flu vaccination appointment on [F]lu [F]inder, he noticed that there’s an option for him to filter locations based on liking. Soren first entered his home address in the search bar and a list of locations came up. Underneath the search bar was the filter option. There were 2 options. The first one let’s him filter by distance. There were two drop menus, with the first representing the minimum distance and the second representing the maximum distance. Soren puts in 1-3 miles. Next, there was an option for him to filter which location opens late. First, this filter had the option for him to select which day of the week he prefers. Additionally, there was an option for him to select phrases like “opens before”, “opens during”, and “opens after” followed by an option to input the time. Soren selects “opens after” and puts in 6:30pm. Once he puts in these filters, he clicks on the “filter” button and the page refreshed with locations that fit his criteria. Soren also notice that there was a “sort” option that allows him to sort by which locations are the closest to him. He ended up settling for CVS. This filter and sort option made him happy because it saved him a lot of time.
