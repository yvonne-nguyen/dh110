# Assignment 5: Interface Design 
Yvonne Nguyen | DH 110

### Purpose
My project is centered around an app that assists users in finding and scheduling a vaccine. The purpose of an interface design is to make the user's experience with using a product as "smooth" as possible. Interface design primarily focuses on the aesthetics of a product: typography, layout, color, etc. 

#### Wireframe
This is a screenshot that provides a brief overview of what my wireframes look like. I cannot take a screen of all of my screens because I have over 20 and that would obscure the details on each indvividual screen. The link to my Figma prototype is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/EkkyhsjrsY9pp6xjSA3D2a/dh110-assignment-6%3A-high-fidelity-prototype?node-id=0%3A1).
