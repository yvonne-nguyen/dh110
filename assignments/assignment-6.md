# Assignment 5: Interface Design 
Yvonne Nguyen | DH 110

## Purpose
My project is centered around an app that assists users in finding and scheduling a vaccine. The purpose of an interface design is to make the user's experience with using a product as "smooth" as possible. Interface design primarily focuses on the aesthetics of a product: typography, layout, color, etc. 

### Wireframe
This is a screenshot that provides a brief overview of what my wireframes look like. I cannot take a screen of all of my screens because I have over 20 and that would obscure the details on each indvividual screen. The link to my Figma prototype is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/EkkyhsjrsY9pp6xjSA3D2a/dh110-assignment-6%3A-high-fidelity-prototype?node-id=0%3A1).

## Screen Design & Design System
### Typographic Variations
I tested out the fonts Arial, Arial Rounded MT Bold, and Dongle, respectively. Right from the beginning, I want my app to have a "professional" appearance. Therefore, I opted for a font that deemed "professional": Arial. However, Arial is, in my opinon, very bland. Next, I tried out Arial Rounded MT Bold. I really like this font because of the rounded corners. It makes the font have a more "warm" and "friendly" feel (compared to a font that has sharp corners). However, this typeface is only offered in bold (there isn't a regular, light, or italics version) so I was a bit hesitant on using it although I really like the friendly vibes it was giving off. I then went onto the Google Fonts website to look for another option. I chose Dongle because it resembles Arial Rounded MT Bold while having a “light” and “regular” option. However, Dongle felt a little bit too “cartoon-y” for me. It was deviating too much from the “professional” feel I initially wanted to go for. Therefore, despite only having one typeface option, I opted for Arial Rounded MT Bold. It looks professional, while having a warm and friendly feel to it. Since this font is only “bold”, I didn’t have to worry too much about lightness/heaviness. However, as I was designing and based on my impression feedback, I do have some trouble differentiating the header from the body text. My header is 50pt, with “header 2” being 22pt. The body text varies, from 16pt-18pt, depending on how much information is on a given screen.

### Shape Variations
This screenshot captures 3 shape variations throughout my design. First is the circle used to indicate which date is being selected. I wanted to emphasize the date the user selected so they do not have to second guess which date they initially selected. I opted for a circle instead of a square because it feels more intuitive (to me at least). When I mark an important date on a calendar, I tend to circle the date instead of squaring it. The other two shapes are the “apply” button and the buttons for selecting which time the user wants their appointment to be at. These buttons are both rectangles but their roundness varies because I wanted to emphasize how they serve different purposes. The button for selecting the time is similar to the checkbox buttons throughout my design. I wanted this to emphasize select only one option because for the checkboxes, the user can only select one option. I wanted the design to be consistent

### Layout
My design has three layouts, “home”, “good”, and “results”, respectively. In hindsight, I probably should not use “good”. It was just the first world that came to my mind at the time. At first, I started off with designing a layout for my onboarding screen, but it turns out I needed a different layout for my following screens because those screens require more content. “Home” has 3 properties. The first contains 2 rows on the “top”, with the height of 80, offset of 30, and gutter of 25. The second the 1 column in the middle, it has the properties “stretch, with an auto width, and margin of 30. The last contains 2 rows located on the “bottom”, with the height of 40, offset of 30, and gutter of 150. The “good” layout emphasizes the lists of options (e.g., vaccine selection) the user will encounter. Each row then has each “section” of the list carved out. The “good” layout has A LOT (7 properties), but I will go over what the most important one.
