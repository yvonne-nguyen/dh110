## 10 Usability Heuristics
### :vertical_traffic_light:1. Visibility of System Status

  Visual depiction(s) that relay information regarding the system's status to the user.
  
  Purpose: Aids user in their decision making process and establishes trust between the user and the system. 
  
  Examples: Traffic light signaling when one should stop/go and progress bar conveying how much time has elapsed when one is listening to a song or watching a movie. 

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

  The system conveys information to the user through familiar words, phrases, concepts, etc. (i.e., the manner through which the information is conveyed matches the real world), rather than through system-oriented terms.
  
  **Purpose**: The system is accessible to users of all technical skillsets and backgrounds. 
  
  **Example**: Use of colloquial lanaguage (e.g., a weather app uses the word "sunny" instead of "cloudless") and conventional color symbolisms (e.g., red signifies "stop" or "error" and green signifies "go" or "progress"). 

### 3. User Control & Freedom

  There will be instances where the user will choose certain system functions by mistake; hence, there should be a quick option for users to exit, undo, or redo their actions. 

  **Purpose**: Allow users to amend their mistakes. 
  
  **Example**: Undo, redo, and back button.

### 4. Consistency and Standards

  The manner through which information is conveyed is consistent, familiar, or learnable. There are two types of consistency: internal and external. Internal consistency holds that product, or a family or products, should be consistent. External consistency adhers to industry standards. 
  
  **Purpose**: Reduces confusion.
  
  **Examples**: 
  
  Internal consistency: Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms implements the same layout that displays one's documents. 
  
  External consistency: a "magnifying icon" (:mag:) symbolizes 'search'. 

### 5. Recognition Rather Than Recall

  Recognition and recall are two forms of memory retrival. Recognition involves remembering something through cues; however, in recall, those cues are ontologically absent. Given this, recognition improves usability because the user will find the system to familiar.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user process information and navigate the system quickly and efficiently. 
  
  **Examples**:
  
  Recognition: Seeing someone you know on the street. 
  
  Recall: Remembering their phone number. 
  

### 6. Error Prevention

  Sometimes, users perform unconscious errors. In order to mitigate the occurances of these errors, the system should implement certain restraints and give users suggestions.

  **Purpose**: Helps prevent errors.
  
  **Examples**: Autofill and autocorrect. 

### 7. Flexibility & Efficency of Use

  The system should cater to the needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Purpose**: Addressing the different needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Examples**: Adobe Photoshop offers application walkthroughs and tool descriptions for novice users. It also allows workspace layout customizations for expert users. 

### 8. Aesthetic & Minimal Design

  The system's appearance should not be visually abstract or distracting. 

  **Purpose**: Helps user feel more comfortable interacting with the system.  
  
  **Example**: Webpages usually have a static white background rather than a GIF or a bright neon color. 

### 9. Help Users with Errors

  Error messages should be comprehendable, highlight the issue, and offer a solution to fix it.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user recognize and solve their errors.
  
  **Example**: A message popping up when the user provides incorrect login information. This could then prompt the user to try again, assit them in retrieving their username, or help them reset their passsword. 

### 10. Help & Documentation

  Documentation should be provided to help users understand their task(s). 
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user navigate and/or troublshoot the system.
  
  **Examples**: Tutorials and customer support.
