## 10 Usability Heuristics
### :vertical_traffic_light:1. Visibility of System Status

  Visual depiction(s) that relay information regarding the system's status to the user.
  
  Purpose: Aids user in their decision making process and establishes trust between the user and the system. 
  
  Examples: Traffic light signaling when one should stop/go and progress bar conveying how much time has elapsed when one is listening to a song or watching a movie. 

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

  The system conveys information to the user through familiar words, phrases, concepts, etc. (i.e., the manner through which the information is conveyed matches the real world), rather than through system-oriented terms.
  
  **Purpose**: The system is accessible to users of all technical skillsets and backgrounds. 
  
  **Example**: Use of colloquial lanaguage (e.g., a weather app uses the word "sunny" instead of "cloudless") and conventional color symbolisms (e.g., red signifies "stop" or "error" and green signifies "go" or "progress"). 

### 3. User Control & Freedom

  There will be instances where the user will choose certain system functions by mistake; hence, there should be a quick option for users to exit, undo, or redo their actions. 

  **Purpose**: Allow users to amend their mistakes. 
  
  **Example**: Undo, redo, and back button.

### 4. Consistency and Standards

  The manner through which information is conveyed is consistent, familiar, or learnable. There are two types of consistency: internal and external. Internal consistency holds that product, or a family or products, should be consistent. External consistency adhers to industry standards. 
  
  **Purpose**: Reduces confusion.
  
  **Examples**: 
  
  Internal consistency: Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms implements the same layout that displays one's documents. 
  
  External consistency: a "magnifying icon" (:mag:) symbolizes 'search'. 

### 5. Recognition Rather Than Recall

  Recognition and recall are two forms of memory retrival. Recognition involves remembering something through cues; however, in recall, those cues are ontologically absent. Given this, recognition improves usability because the user will find the system to familiar.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user process information and navigate the system quickly and efficiently. 
  
  **Examples**:
  
  Recognition: Seeing someone you know on the street. 
  
  Recall: Remembering their phone number. 
  

### 6. Error Prevention

  Sometimes, users perform unconscious errors. In order to mitigate the occurances of these errors, the system should implement certain restraints and give users suggestions.

  **Purpose**: Helps prevent errors.
  
  **Examples**: Autofill and autocorrect. 

### 7. Flexibility & Efficency of Use

  The system should cater to the needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Purpose**: Addressing the different needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Examples**: Adobe Photoshop offers application walkthroughs and tool descriptions for novice users. It also allows workspace layout customizations for expert users. 

### 8. Aesthetic & Minimal Design

  The system's appearance should not be visually abstract or distracting. 

  **Purpose**: Helps user feel more comfortable interacting with the system.  
  
  **Example**: Webpages usually have a static white background rather than a GIF or a bright neon color. 

### 9. Help Users with Errors

  Error messages should be comprehendable, highlight the issue, and offer a solution to fix it.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user recognize and solve their errors.
  
  **Example**: A message popping up when the user provides incorrect login information. This could then prompt the user to try again, assit them in retrieving their username, or help them reset their passsword. 

### 10. Help & Documentation

  Documentation should be provided to help users understand their task(s). 
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user navigate and/or troublshoot the system.
  
  **Examples**: Tutorials and customer support.

## Heuristic Evaluation of Oregon's Department of Transportation Website

 Heuristic | Evaluation | Suggestions | Severity Rating
------------ | ------------- | -------------| ------------- |
Visibility of System Status | **Pro**: Color of the link changes when the user hovers over a link. <br><br> **Pro**: Each page has a different header, this helps the user identify which page they're on. | None. | 1
Match Between System and Real World | **Pro**: The header of each category uses language that succinctly conveys which category it is. <br><br>**Pro**: When the user clicks on the "change of address" link, they are taken to a page that asks for information on their driver's license. An image of a diver's licesne with annotations of where to find certain information is also presented. | None. | 1
User Control & Freedom | **Pro**: If the user navigates to the wrong page, they have the option to return to the home page. <br><br> **Con**: One way for the user to navigate back to the home page is through clicking on the text on the header. However, there is also the Department of Transportation logo right next to the text. If the user clicks on this logo instead of the text, it takes them back to the Oregon.gov hompage, not the Department of Transportation homepage. | Needs consistency. Either make both the logo and the text navigate back to either the Oregon.gov homepage or the Department of Transportation homepage. | 2
Consistency and Standards | **Pro**: The manner through which individual sub-sections are visually presented on the homepage is visually consistent. <br><br> **Pro**: Each sub-section page has a consistent layout: an additional menu bar with additional sub-sections related to that page is located on the left. <br><br>**Pro**: Links that will take the user to a PDF instead of another page will have a "â–¡" next to it. | None. | 1
Recognition Rather Than Recall | **Pro**: When the user clicks on the "magnifying icon" on the right, a search bar pops out. <br><br> **Pro**: Links to Oregon state government are represented through the respective social media icon. | None. | 1
Error Prevention | **Pro**: If the user makes a typing error in the search bar, there is a "Did you mean:" followed by a suggested spelling.<br><br>**Con**: This suggestion does not appear while the user is typing in the search bar. It only shows up after the user input the text.
