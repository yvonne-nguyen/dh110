## :evergreen_tree:Oregon
So why Oregon? To be candid, and I'm not sure if this is an embarrassing confession or not, I was initially attracted to learning more about Oregon because one of my favorite astrologers lives there. I've heard so much about Portland (partially due to pop culture influences such as *Portlandia*) and the culture that surrounds that city fascinates me. Aside from this, Oregon's natural landscape is beyond sceneic. Oregon is an underrated state. It is, in my opinon, overlooked compard to the other states in the West Coast. It deserves more love. It deserves more attention. This project investigates Oregon from the perspective of its federal government.

## 10 Usability Heuristics
### 1. Visibility of System Status

  Visual depiction(s) that relay information regarding the system's status to the user.
  
  Purpose: Aids user in their decision making process and establishes trust between the user and the system. 
  
  Examples: Traffic light signaling when one should stop/go and progress bar conveying how much time has elapsed when one is listening to a song or watching a movie. 

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

  The system conveys information to the user through familiar words, phrases, concepts, etc. (i.e., the manner through which the information is conveyed matches the real world), rather than through system-oriented terms.
  
  **Purpose**: The system is accessible to users of all technical skillsets and backgrounds. 
  
  **Example**: Use of colloquial lanaguage (e.g., a weather app uses the word "sunny" instead of "cloudless") and conventional color symbolisms (e.g., red signifies "stop" or "error" and green signifies "go" or "progress"). 

### 3. User Control & Freedom

  There will be instances where the user will choose certain system functions by mistake; hence, there should be a quick option for users to exit, undo, or redo their actions. 

  **Purpose**: Allow users to amend their mistakes. 
  
  **Example**: Undo, redo, and back button.

### 4. Consistency and Standards

  The manner through which information is conveyed is consistent, familiar, or learnable. There are two types of consistency: internal and external. Internal consistency holds that product, or a family or products, should be consistent. External consistency adhers to industry standards. 
  
  **Purpose**: Reduces confusion.
  
  **Examples**: 
  
  Internal consistency: Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms implements the same layout that displays one's documents. 
  
  External consistency: a "magnifying icon" (:mag:) symbolizes 'search'. 

### 5. Recognition Rather Than Recall

  Recognition and recall are two forms of memory retrival. Recognition involves remembering something through cues; however, in recall, those cues are ontologically absent. Given this, recognition improves usability because the user will find the system to familiar.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user process information and navigate the system quickly and efficiently. 
  
  **Examples**:
  
  Recognition: Seeing someone you know on the street. 
  
  Recall: Remembering their phone number. 
  

### 6. Error Prevention

  Sometimes, users perform unconscious errors. In order to mitigate the occurances of these errors, the system should implement certain restraints and give users suggestions.

  **Purpose**: Helps prevent errors.
  
  **Examples**: Autofill and autocorrect. 

### 7. Flexibility & Efficency of Use

  The system should cater to the needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Purpose**: Addressing the different needs of expert and novice users. 
  
  **Examples**: Adobe Photoshop offers application walkthroughs and tool descriptions for novice users. It also allows workspace layout customizations for expert users. 

### 8. Aesthetic & Minimal Design

  The system's appearance should not be visually abstract or distracting. 

  **Purpose**: Helps user feel more comfortable interacting with the system.  
  
  **Example**: Webpages usually have a static white background rather than a GIF or a bright neon color. 

### 9. Help Users with Errors

  Error messages should be comprehendable, highlight the issue, and offer a solution to fix it.
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user recognize and solve their errors.
  
  **Example**: A message popping up when the user provides incorrect login information. This could then prompt the user to try again, assit them in retrieving their username, or help them reset their passsword. 

### 10. Help & Documentation

  Documentation should be provided to help users understand their task(s). 
  
  **Purpose**: Helps user navigate and/or troublshoot the system.
  
  **Examples**: Tutorials and customer support.

### Severity Rating

**1**: No usuability problems.

**2**: Minor usability problems. 

**3**: Serious usability problems.

## Heuristic Evaluation of Oregon's Department of Transportation Website

![ODOT website](/assignments/3.png)
Link to the website: https://www.oregon.gov/odot/Pages/index.aspx

**Background Information**: This is Oregon's Department of Transportation website. It contains information about the various areas that the ODOT oversees, such as the DMV, vehicle permits, and job openings in the department. The website also contains information such as child safety belts, DMV online services, information regarding funding for public transportation, etc. 

**Overall Evaluation**: For how much information they include in the homepage, the website looks clean/not cultered. The addition of pictures for each individual section on the homepage, and their subsequent individual pages, is a nice addition. A list of common reasons why for people often go on that website (e.g., online DMV services or changing one's address) is convinently located on the homepage. A search bar is also included, however, if a user is not well-verse on what different icons represent, they might be unable to find it because the search bar only appears once the user clicks on the magnifying glass icon.

Heuristic | Evaluation | Suggestions | Severity Rating
------------ | ------------- | -------------| ------------- |
Visibility of System Status | **Pro**: Color of the link changes when the user hovers over a link. <br><br> **Pro**: Each page has a different header, this helps the user identify which page they're on. **Con**: The search bar only appears after the user clicks on the magnifying glass icon.| The magnifying glass icon representing the "search" option might not be intuitive to some. Because of this, the search bar should be easier to access. | 3
Match Between System and Real World | **Pro**: The header of each category uses language that succinctly conveys which category it is. <br><br>**Pro**: When the user clicks on the "change of address" link, they are taken to a page that asks for information on their driver's license. An image of a diver's licesne with annotations of where to find certain information is also presented. | None. | 1
User Control & Freedom | **Pro**: If the user navigates to the wrong page, they have the option to return to the home page. <br><br> **Con**: One way for the user to navigate back to the home page is through clicking on the text on the header. However, there is also the Department of Transportation logo right next to the text. If the user clicks on this logo instead of the text, it takes them back to the Oregon.gov hompage, not the Department of Transportation homepage. | Needs consistency. Make both the logo and the text navigate back to either the Oregon.gov homepage or the Department of Transportation homepage. | 3
Consistency and Standards | **Pro**: The manner through which individual sub-sections are visually presented on the homepage is visually consistent. <br><br> **Pro**: Each sub-section page has a consistent layout: an additional menu bar with additional sub-sections related to that page is located on the left. <br><br>**Pro**: Links that will take the user to a PDF instead of another page will have a "â–¡" next to it. | None. | 1
Recognition Rather Than Recall | **Pro**: When the user clicks on the "magnifying icon" on the right, a search bar pops out. <br><br> **Pro**: Links to Oregon state government are represented through the respective social media icon. | None. | 1
Error Prevention | **Pro**: If the user makes a typing error in the search bar, the user can "command + Z" to quickly undo their mistake. | None. | 1
Flexibility & Efficency of Use | **Pro**: Additional links for the sub-sections on the homepage have generic topics that usually apply to most people (e.g., changing one's address and job openings). However, links on the header above provide more niche sub-sections (e.g., Fuels Tax Group). <br><br>**Con**: There are many sub-sections that are difficult to find/navigate to if one is not well-verse about the arrangement of the website. | Adding a sitemap that outlines all sections and their subsequent sub-sections will be useful for both novice and expert users. This way, users can "command/control + F" on the sitemap page in order to quickly navigate to their desired page. | 2
Aesthetic & Minimal Design | **Pro**: There is a link to 'Website Accessibility' that states Oregon's government websites' design purpose.<br><br>**Pro**: The overall color scheme of the website is easy on the eyes and accssibile to those who are color-blind. | 1
Help Users with Errors | **Pro**: If the user makes a typing error in the search bar, there is a "Did you mean:" followed by a suggested spelling.<br><br>**Con**: This suggestion does not appear while the user is typing in the search bar. It only shows up after the user input the text.| There should be a way to indicate that the user made a typing error, or offer some "autofill" suggestions, while they are typing in the search bar. | 2
Help & Documentation | **Pro**: There is a section that provides a tutorial (i.e., Youtube video) on how one should navigate the website. <br><br> **Pro**: There is also a link that allows one to email Oregon's government and two phone numbers (one for the DMV and one for Oregon's Department of Transportation). | None. | 1

## Heuristic Evaluation of Oregon's Stateparks Website

![stateparks](/assignments/4.png)
Link to the website: https://stateparks.oregon.gov

**Background Information**: Oregon's Stateparks Website lists all of the state parks in Oregon, information about each park (e.g., a quick description about the pak, times of operation, if a park is currently open, the park's location, if one could camp overnight at a park) how to researve a park, acitivies one could do at a park, etc.

**Overall Evaluation**: The website's flat layout is very appealing (it looks more "modern" compared to the Department of Transportation website). In the 'find a park' section, if the user hovers over a certain park, the map on the right side of the screen will "highlight" which park the user is hovering over. This is very convinent because it allows users to quickly get a gist of where the park is located. The map also indicates which parks allow overnight camping through the use of a distinct icon. If the map is distracting, there is also a toggle to turn the map on/off. There is also a search bar on top that allows users to find a park that is close to the city of their choice. 

Heuristic | Evaluation | Suggestions | Severity Rating
------------ | ------------- | -------------| ------------- |
Visibility of System Status | **Pro**: The toggle to turn the map on/off animates like a light switch.<br><br>**Pro**: When one uses the "status" or "filter" option to narrow down a park, the number of parks found that match one's criteria is updated. | None. | 1
Match Between System and Real World | **Pro**: When one hovers over a park, the map on the side highlights where that park is located.<br><br>**Pro**: Parks that allow overnight camping have a logo of a tent represented next to it; when one hovers over the tent, the text, "overnight camping" appears.<br><br>**Pro**: When one clicks on a specific park, the temperature and weather conditions of that area is also listed. | None. | 1
User Control & Freedom | **Pro**: There is an toggle for the user to turn the map back on if they click to turn it off.<br><br>**Pro**: When the user clicks on a filter and deicdes to change their mind, they can click on the filter again to 'undo' that step. | None. | 1
Consistency and Standards | **Pro**: Parks that allow overnight camping is represented by the tent icon.<br><br> **Pro**: The website over is very consistent. Texts that are links are contrasted through a distinctive green color and is also underlined.<br><br>**Pro**: Descriptions of each park includes features and amenities, local weather, hours of opporation, pictures, general questions, the park's phone number(s), and hours of opporation. On the Park Reservation page, the Oregon Stateparks logo covers the first header.| The header itself is too far to the left. Move it a bit over to the right so the logo doesn't cover the text. | 2
Recognition Rather Than Recall | **Pro**: On the 'find a park' page, a map is also included to highlight where the park is located. This is convinent because sometimes, it's difficult for users to recall where a certain address is.<br><br>**Pro**: On the 'Oregon Coast Trail' page, information about closed trails are highlighted red to show that that information is important.<br><br>**Con**: On the 'Nehalem Bay State Park' page, the description lists which Loops are closed or are reservable. This information is not easily accessible to those who are unfamilar with the park's layout. | Every park description page should include a map of the park. For parks like Nehalem Bay State Park that have certain trails closed off, the map should highlight with trails are closed. | 3
Error Prevention | **Pro**: In the search bar, there is an "autofill" feature so when users type in, for example, the letter "a", parks that contain "a" will appear...the list of parks that appears gradually become smaller as more letters are typed. | None. | 1
Flexibility & Efficency of Use | **Pro**: The 'Scenic Bikeways' page lists trails that are 'mild', 'moderate', and 'challenging'.<br><br>**Pro**: There is a filter option that allows users to narrow down which features they prioritize in choosing which park to visit. | None. | 1
Aesthetic & Minimal Design | **Pro**: The flat design looks very clean and modern.<br><br>**Pro**: The color scheme is very simple. Green is used to highlight important information. It's fitting because green corresponds to nature and this is parks website.| None. | 1
Help Users with Errors | **Pro**: When the user makes a typing error in the search bar on the homepage, the search bar "shakes" a little, the borders change to red, and text appears on the bottom that states 'We cannot find this location near Oregon'.| None. | 1
Help & Documentation | **Pro**: There is an extensive FAQ page on almost every page. For example, on individual park description pages, there's information regarding what one can and cannot do at the park.<br><br>**Pro**: The 'Contact Us' page has an option for the user to write an email to this department and various phone numbers.<br><br>**Con**: There isn't a general FAQ section that applies to the whole website. There isn't a tutorial on how to navigate the website. | Include a general FAQ section and add tutorials on how the user should navigate the website. Possibly, include some tutorials such as 'how to make a park reservation' as well. | 2
